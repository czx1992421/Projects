This is the instruction for Pig.

Technically, you can install pig and run all samples in both local and map reduce mode. The only thing you need to be careful is the path/directory. The following samples are based on my own path and directory, please change them into yours before running them.

A. Installation of Pig:
https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/setup.html
Download pig and run following sentence:

export PATH=/<my-path-to-pig>/pig-n.n.n/bin:$PATH


B. Pig demo:
Preprocessing:

Set up path and java_home
export PATH=/Users/Rich/Documents/Courses/Fall2014/BigData/Pig/pig-0.13.0/bin:$PATH

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home


1. Run hadoop:

ssh localhost

cd /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.7.1

2. If you have removed all hadoop cache, please remember run this command first:
bin/hdfs namenode -format

3. Start hadoop and yarn:
sbin/start-dfs.sh
sbin/start-yarn.sh

4. Upload files to HDFS
bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /PigSource

PigSource is the directory you store Pig source file

You can check whether it works by:
bin/hdfs dfs -ls / 

Now, you can upload your pig source file and data file:
bin/hdfs dfs -put /Users/Rich/Documents/Courses/Spring2014/CloudComputing/HW/MINI5/movies_data.csv /PigSource

if you would like to remove it:

bin/hdfs dfs -rm /PigSource/movies_data.csv

If you would like to check whether files have already been uploaded:

bin/hdfs dfs -ls /PigSource 

5. Run your pig code in local mode

pig -x local

movies = LOAD '/Users/Rich/Documents/Courses/Fall2014/BigData/Pig/movies_data.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (id,name,year,rating,duration);

DUMP movies

(1). List the movies that were released between 1950 and 1960 
movies_1950_1960 = FILTER movies BY (float)year>1949 and (float)year<1961;
store movies_1950_1960 into '/Users/Rich/Desktop/Demo/movies_1950_1960'; 

(2). List the movies that have a duration of greater than 2 hours 
movies_two_hours = FILTER movies BY (float)duration>7200;
store movies_two_hours into '/Users/Rich/Desktop/Demo/movies_two_hours'; 

(3). List the movies that have ratings between 3 and 4 
movies_rating_3_4 = FILTER movies BY (float)rating>3 and (float) rating <4;
store movies_rating_3_4 into '/Users/Rich/Desktop/Demo/movies_rating_3_4'; 

(4). List movie names and year 
movies_year = foreach movies generate name, year;
store movies_year into '/Users/Rich/Desktop/Demo/movies_year'; 

(float)duration/3600

(5). List all movies in descending order of year 
movies_year_sort =order movies by year desc;
store movies_year_sort into '/Users/Rich/Desktop/Demo/movies_year_sort'; 



6. Run your pig code in map reduce mode:

You have two ways to run:

I. Run pig command in grunt:

pig

movies = LOAD '/PigSource/movies_data.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (id,name,year,rating,duration);

DUMP movies

II. Run .pig file in map reduce mode using files on HDFS

pig /Users/Rich/Documents/Courses/Fall2014/BigData/Pig/run1.pig
